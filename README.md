# Metaheuristics-Algorithm

## There are *FOUR MAIN STAGE*, we have some algorithm below

* Iinitialization
    ```
    assign all zero to vector 
                or
    some particular element that you want
    ```
* Modification
    ```
    *Tweak* a candidate solution, which produces a
    *randomly slightly different* candidate solution
    ```
    > Tweak as known as Modification procedure
    > btw, we can also Tweak all the elements in a vector
    

* Assessment
    ```
    Assess the Quality of a candidate solution
    ```   
    > evaluate as known as Assessment precudure
    
* Selection
    ```
    If eval(S) > eval(tweak(S)):
        repeat tweak(S)
    Else
        replace S by tweak(S)
        then repeat tweak(S)
    ```

# Description for ONE-MAX problem

The Max One problem is a very simple problem where evolution is used to find a *specific binary string*


- Example of a random individual: <100101101101110100101010101110001>

- Target for the problem: <111111111111111111111111111111111>

The objective in this problem is to find a binary string that is identical to a specified target

> So, onemax is a *Combinatorial and Discrete problem*,
> there are tons of combinations of the answer to be found

## ONEMAX Solving By Exhaustive Search

The spirit of Exhaustive search is very simple that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.

> Exhaustive Search as known as Brute-force search

### Compile and Execute

## ONEMAX Solving By Hill Climbing

The spirit of Exhaustive search is that you just iteratively test new candidate solutions in the region of your current candidate, and adopt the new ones if theyâ€™re better, This enables you to climb up the hill until you reach a local optimum.

> In here, we apply Hill-Climbing with Random Range
> It means that we do Hill-Climbing for a certain random range of binary string in each iteration

### Compile and Execute
> Execute by shell command
```
$ g++ onemax-solving-by-HC.cpp
$ ./a.exe {bit size} {durations limits} {affect range}
```
